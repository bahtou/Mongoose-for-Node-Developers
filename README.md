WEEK 6
========

---

Week six is about replica sets and sharding  
The homework is contained in the `HW_6.md` file.  
No work was done using the `blog`

###Aside
I also went ahead and bootstrapped the blog page .  It looks a little better and easier on the eyes.  

The `views\layout` file contains the `head` and `nav-bar` instead of being in their separate `includes` folder.  Once you get the hang of it bootstrap is pretty cool.  

There was no effort on my part to reduce repeat code.  It would be good practice to implement DRY.

**Don't forget to get the node_modules**  

```
npm install
```
