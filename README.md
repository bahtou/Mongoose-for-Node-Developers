**10genEducation**
==============

A course **M101: MongoDB for Developers** is being offered at [10gen](https://education.10gen.com/).  

The course is using `python` to stage working with mongo database.  
I am currently working with `node.js` so it's only logical that I mimic the course using `node.js`.  

Feel free to follow along, contribute and `donkey.punch` me if my code begins to anything like a flying spaghetti monster.


**Requirements**
----------------
Through the course I will be using:

*  [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) v3.0.0
*  [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/index.html) v3.3.1
*  and of course [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.8.14



**Install**
----------

*    Clone this repo `https://github.com/bahtou/Mongoose-for-Node-Developers.git`
*    Switch between the weekly branches to follow along `git checkout week_01`, `git checkout week_02`, ... etc.  

**Notices**
-----------
Every week will have its own `README` so make sure to check them out for additional notes about the homework for that given week.
